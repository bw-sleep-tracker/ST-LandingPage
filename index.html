          <p class="about-text">Sleep Tracker is a simple and intuitive tool for tracking your sleeping patterns and moods. By inputting your hours of sleep and ratings of your mood,
            Sleep Tracker will help you gain an accurate representation of your overall sleep health. After a certain amount of time, the app will even have enough information
            to give you a recommendation about how many hours of sleep it thinks you should be getting daily to maximize your mood for the day!

              <p class="content-text">It's hard to remember exactly how many hours you slept on which day. This makes it difficult
                to see how much sleep you're actually getting over time and makes it even harder to adjust your sleep schedule appropriately.
                </p>
              <p class="content-text">Sleep Tracker makes it easy to record and track your sleep schedule, whether that be daily, weekly,
                monthly, or even yearly. By simply inputting your sleep data, Sleep Tracker will begin logging your sleep schedule and
                begin outputting informative graphs based on your desired time interval. Never again will you have to wonder about your
                sleep habits because Sleep Tracker gives you all the information you need.

              <p class="content-text">Sometimes, you might wake up wondering why you feel so groggy even after you've gotten 
                plenty of sleep. However, did you know that each person's body has their own ideal number of hours of sleep?
                </p>
              <p class="content-text">
                With Sleep Tracker, you can record your daily mood levels, both in the morning after you wake up and in the 
                daytime when you've been awake for a while, in order to give you an accurate representation of how you feel
                after a certain amount of hours of sleep. This way, you can slowly adjust how long you sleep in order to
                optimize your mood levels for the day.
